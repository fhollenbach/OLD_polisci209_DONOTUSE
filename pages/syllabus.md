### COURSE DESCRIPTION: 

> “I keep saying that the sexy job in the next 10 years will be statisticians, And I’m not kidding.”

Hal Varian, chief economist at Google


> “Without data you’re just another person with an opinion.”

W. Edwards Deming


Data and data analysis are becoming more and more important for us
as citizens in the modern nation state, the modern work place, and as
consumers of increasingly complex information. At the same time, the
understanding of statistical fundamentals is as pertinent as ever to
read any political science research. This class serves two main
purposes. First, it will help you understand the basic statistics that
are necessary to read modern political science research. Second, you
will gain an understanding of basic methods of data analysis and the
underlying concepts of probability. We will also cover some
introductory programming, so that you will be able to write code for
basic statistical functions and plots in
[R](https://www.r-project.org/about.html). 

### LEARNING OUTCOMES:
At the end of the semester, after completing this course, students are expected to:

- Understand the concept of causality and experimental designs

- Be able to do simple programming in R, such as:
  - plot and interpret histograms, scatterplots, boxplots
  - run simple statistical models
  - simple mapping
  
- Explain and understand simple descriptive, univariate, and bivariate
statistical concepts, such as:
	– mean
	– (co)variance, correlation
	– measurement
	– Central Limit Theorem
	– bivariate linear regression
	– multivariate linear regression
	- hypothesis tests


### COURSE STRUCTURE & REQUIREMENTS:

The class will meet three times a week on Monday, Wednesday, and
Friday. Classes will not simply be lecture based. We will cover programming, examples, or go
over problem sets. This class will cover a variety of
(complicated) concepts. Generally concepts will first be covered in
the readings and we will go over specific applications and your
questions on these concepts in class. It is therefore important that
you do the required reading before each class period. For most weeks,
the readings & topics covered can be quite technical and challenging,
which means it is even more important that you try to understand the
material before coming to class. If you do not understand part of the
readings, it is important to __raise questions in class__. That is the
whole purpose of class time. I guarantee you will not be the only one
that has trouble with the material and by asking questions, you are
providing a service to your classmates. There will be regular homework
and practice assignments. The assignments are for you to deepen your
understanding of the material and study for the exam. Some of the
assignments will be quite hard. It is, however, important for your own
progress that you at least attempt to solve each problem on your own
first, before seeking help. If you are stuck, I encourage you to seek
help from your classmates, the TA, or myself.

You are expected to do all readings prior to class, participate in
class discussions, submit all assignments on time, and take exams as
scheduled.



###  GRADING & RESPONSIBILITIES:

Your grade will be based on two exams (40 % combined) at the middle
and end of the semester, class attendance, participation, and exercises (30% combined), and
three written assignments (30% combined). All assignments are due before
class on the day they are listed on the syllabus.

I expect you to do the assigned readings for each class before the
lecture, participate in class discussions, and come prepared with
questions. Specifically, you will be graded on:

- homework assignments/review exercises: 20% of class
grade
	- homework assignments and review exercises will be graded on
          pass/fail, i.e. your grade will be the percentage of
          exercises you passed. You are allowed to miss two exercises
          unexcused, i.e. if there are 20 total assignments your grade
          will be the number of passed assignments divided by 18 (maximum 100%).

- class attendance/participation: 10% of class grade
	-  Attendance will be marked at the beginning of each
           class. You are allowed to have two free absences. After two
           absences, I will deduct one point from the 10 possible
           attendance points for each absence. Excused absences do not
           deduct from your free absences. I will decide what counts
           as excused on a case-by-case basis, but in general absences
           will only be excused for good reasons. You must contact me
           __before__ class.
		   If you have more than 15 unexcused absences, you will
           receive an F in the course. Similarly, while unexpected
           events can cause tardiness, if you repeatedly arrive
           late to class, I reserve the right to mark late arrivals as
           absences. Should you arrive to class late, be sure to let
           me know after class so that I can mark you as present.
	- I expect all students to participate in class discussion, ask
           questions, listen to their fellow students, and be
           attentive. If you repeatedly fail to pay attention
           (e.g. fall asleep or play on your cell phone), I may
           deduct points from your participation/attendance grade.

- Three writing assignment: 30% of class grade (10% each)
	- The writing assignments in this class will be short memos
          (each 700 words) and are supposed to prepare you for real
          world work assignments. They will involve work with data in
          R. The writing assigments will be structured
          with the requirements of the modern work place in mind. For
          each of the three assignment you will provide a first draft to a fellow
          student, who will provide comments. You will incorporate the
          comments and will then be graded on the final version.
		  Your comments to your fellow students will be graded
          pass/fail as a homework exercise.
		  __The final version of the written assignments are to be
          submitted via Turnitin on eCampus prior to class on the day
          they are due.__
		  
- Exam 1: 15% of class grade
	- The first exam will cover the first half of the semester and
          will be worth 15% of your class grade. The exams focus on
          all of the material covered up to the exam, includng the
          readings, lectures, and exercises. The assigned exercises
          should serve as excellent preparation for the exams
		  
- Final Exam (cumulative): 25% of class grade
	- The final exam will cover the material from the whole
          class and will be worth 25% of your class grade. 

The grading scale (in %) used in this class for all written
assignments, exams, and the overall class grade will be the following:

- A= 89.5
- B= 79.5–<89.5
- C= 69.5–<79.5
- D= 59.5–<69.5
- F=<59.6


Given that this course is an official writing course, you __must pass
the writing__ part of the class to receive graduation credit. As noted
on the website of the Texas A&M Writing Center: "If you complete a
course with a passing grade but have not passed the W or C portion of
the course, you will not get the graduation credit for that W or C
course."

### WRITING HELP:
The University Writing Center (UWC), located in 214 Evans Library and
205 West Campus Library, offers one-on-one consultations to
writers. UWC consultations are highly recommended but are not
required. Help is available with brainstorming, researching, drafting,
documenting, revising, and more; no concern is too large or too small.
UWC consultants will also help you improve your proofreading and
editing skills. If you visit the UWC, take a copy of your writing
assignment, a hard copy of your draft or any notes you may have, as
well as any material you need help with. To find out more about UWC
services or to schedule an appointment, call 458-1455, visit the web
page at writingcenter.tamu.edu, or stop by in person.


### ACADEMIC HONESTY:
All students should follow the highest standards of academic
integrity. Cheating or plagiarism will not be tolerated in any way. If
you are unsure what entails plagiarism, come talk to me. For more
info, see: [http://student-rules.tamu.edu/aggiecode &
http://aggiehonor.tamu.edu](http://student-rules.tamu.edu/aggiecode &
http://aggiehonor.tamu.edu). “An Aggie does not lie, cheat or steal, or
tolerate those who do.”

Regarding group work: Unless explicitly otherwise specified, your
homework and assignments are not to be done in groups and should be
done alone. If you get stuck on a problem, you can discuss it in
general terms with your fellow students, however, all solutions ought
to be based your own work. Before asking for help from your fellow
students, the TA, or myself, make sure you at least attempt to solve
the problem yourself, otherwise you are only hindering your own
learning.

### READINGS & SOFTWARE:
We will primarily use one book, which is available in the Texas A&M
bookstore. Unfortunately the book is quite pricey, but you should be
able to find cheaper versions (used) online. I would strongly
encourage you to acquire the hard copy of the __fourth edition__. All
references will be made with respect to the __fourth edition__ of the
book. If you do decide to get a different version, it will be your
responsibility to make sure you are reading the correct parts and
doing the correct exercises.

__Required book__: Freedman, David, Robert Pisani, and Roger
Purves. 2007. Statistics. 4th Edition. W. W. Norton and Company. New
York. ISBN: 0393929728.

You should have the book within the first week of class.

For part of this class we will be working on the computer with
statistical software. We will use the statistical programming language
__R__. R is available for download [here:](https://cran.revolutionanalytics.com). I would recommend you download
R-Studio, which is a software (a set of integrated tools) that makes
the use of R much easier. You can download R-Studio [here:](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download2/). Both R and
R-Studio are free. I would encourage you to install R-studio and play
around with it for a bit.

You will also need a pocket calculator. You can buy a cheap one for at
Walmart for about $3. Graphing calculators will not be allowed on the
exams, so if you have any questions, please ask. [Here](https://www.amazon.com/Casio-HS8VA-Standard-Function-Calculator/dp/B001GXM68Y/)
is an example from Amazon for a calculator you could use. You should have your calculator by the
Friday September 1st.

### CLASSROOM BEHAVIOR, PARTICIPATION, & ELECTRONIC DEVICES:

We will usually meet three times a week during the semester. You can
expect me to be prepared, give lecture, and answer questions. As
outlined above, when you come to class, I expect you to be prepared as
well and have the reading done before class. Remeber, class is a
resource to you. The exams will be based on all lectures, readings,
homework, and the discussions in class. Thus, only doing the required
readings or only attending class will not be sufficient.



I have decided that for the first time, laptops will not be allowed in
class unless specifically announced. Laptops have been shown to be a
distraction not only to the students using them but also fellow
class mates. [A recent study has found that not having laptops in class
can have a similar effect as hiring a SAT tutor](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/05/16/why-smart-kids-shouldnt-use-laptops-in-class/?utm_term=.5dd2e4949441) 

![Laptops as distraction](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/C9oYA4GUAAI0RKf.jpg:large)

I may make exceptions to this rule, but only if you have good reasons
for why you need to use a computer. If you believe you warrant an exception, please contact me within the
first week of class.

In addition, please make sure your cell phones are on silent mode and
refrain from using them during class time. If you are repeatedly on
your phone, I may deduct points from your participation/attendance
grade.

### EXAM ABSENCES & LATE POLICY:
Make-up exams will be permitted only in the case of university-excused
absences. To be eligible for a make-up exam, you will have to present
original written documentation of legitimate circumstances that
prevented you from taking the exam on time. Except in the case of
observance of a religious holiday, to be excused, the student must
notify his or her instructor in writing (acknowledged e-mail message
is acceptable) prior to the date of absence. In cases where advance
notification is not feasible (e.g. accident or emergency) the student
must provide notification by the end of the second working day after
the absence. This notification should include an explanation of why
notice could not be sent prior to the class. Accommodations sought for
absences due to the observance of a religious holiday can be sought
either prior or after the absence, but not later than two working days
after the absence. Legitimate circumstances include religious
holidays, illness (verified by a doctor), serious family emergencies
and participation in group activities sponsored by the University,
etc. See [http://student-rules.tamu.edu/rule07](http://student-rules.tamu.edu/rule07) for additional
information. Please note that I do not accept Xeroxed copies of
medical excuses from students.

Unexcused absences from either exam will result in a score of 0 for the exam.
Unexcused late work will be penalized by a 7.5 percentage point deduction for each day your work is late. For example, if you hand in the a writing assignment on the same day it is due, but after class, your maximum score will be 92.5%. If you hand in your assignment the next day, your maximum score will be 85%, and so on. Late work will be excused only in the case of university-excused absences.
__There will be no exceptions to these rules.__


### RE-GRADING POLICY:
Students that want to appeal a grade received on an exam or assignment must submit a regrading request in written form (no email). This request has to be turned in within five working days after the graded exams or assignments are returned to the class. The written statement must explain exactly why the student believes the current grade is incorrect. I will then regrade the entire assignment or exam extra carefully. NOTE, as a consequence your grade may go up or down.

### COMMUNICATION:
The best place to ask questions is in the classroom. If your question
is not related to class material or relevant to other students, we can
discuss it after class. I encourage you to visit my office hours to
discuss any difficulties with the readings or homeworks. Again,
however, you should at least attempt to solve the problem on your own
first.

You can expect me to reply to emails within 24 hours during the work
week. I will not reply to emails on the weekend, except for urgent
matters. As with all business related correspondence, please include
an appropriate salutation, identify yourself, and write in complete
sentences.

### DISABILITY:
All discussions will remain confidential. University policy is in
accordance with the Americans with Disabilities Act Policy
Statement. The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) is a federal
anti-discrimination statute that provides comprehensive civil rights
protection for persons with disabilities. Among other things, this
legislation requires that all students with disabilities be guaranteed
a learning environment that provides for reasonable accommodation of
their disabilities. If you believe you have a disability requiring an
accommodation, please contact Disability Services, currently located
in the Disability Services building at the Student Services at White
Creek complex on west campus or call 979-845-1637. For additional
information, visit [http://disability.tamu.edu](http://disability.tamu.edu).

Reasonable accommodations will be made for all students with
disabilities, but it is the student’s responsibility to inform the
instructor early in the term. Do not wait until just before an exam to
decide you want to inform the instructor of a learning disability; any
accommodations for disabilities must be arranged well in advance.

### DIVERSITY POLICY:
The Department of Political Science supports the Texas A&M University
commitment to diversity, and welcomes individuals from any racial,
ethnic, religious, age, gender, sexual orientation, class, disability,
and nationality. (See [http://diversity.tamu.edu/](http://diversity.tamu.edu/). In the spirit of
this vital commitment, in this course each voice in the classroom has
something of value to contribute to all discussions.

Everyone is expected to respect the different experiences, beliefs and
values expressed by fellow students and the instructor, and will
engage in reasoned discussion that refrains from derogatory comments
about other people, cultures, groups, or viewpoints.
